    <h2>Information Overload: Site Redesign</h2>
    <p>Focus: Information Architecture, Wireframing, Usability</p>
    <p>Finding the right balance in providing site users with plenty of information, but not overwhelming them, is a delicate task. Here is an example of a site that could benefit from reorganization.</p>
    <img src="assets/img/redesign1.png" alt="redesign-1" height=400>
    <img src="assets/img/redesign2.png" alt="redesign-2" height=400>
    <img src="assets/img/redesign3.png" alt="redesign-3" height=400>
    <p>The goals for the current site design are to:</p>
    <ul class="left-align">
      <li>Show the firm’s range of capabilities</li>
      <li>Convey experience</li>
      <li>Make sure each visitor can see examples of past projects that closely match what they’re looking for</li>
    </ul>
    <p class= "standalone">Site visitors could experience several problems when navigating this website.</p>
    <ul class="left-align">
      <li>There are many places to click, with up to four rows of options on some pages. User is unsure what to do next.</li>
      <li>It’s hard to highlight the best work first when visitors have too much browsing freedom.</li>
      <li>There are many different ways to access the same content, some of which are shown in the images above.</li>
      <li>The navigation takes up much of the page’s design.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="standalone">This site certainly takes a “more is better” approach, with 36 featured projects and even more non-featured projects.</p>
    <p>The following wireframe provides one possible solution. It keeps the company’s desire for plenty of project content, but organizes it into one place. Controlled, clean navigation lets the user play around with content without getting lost in the weeds. They can browse through many project photos quickly or focus on examples from a single category.</p>
