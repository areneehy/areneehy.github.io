    <h2>Zentripper: A one-stop shop for travel bookers</h2>
    <p>Focus: UX research, user testing, prototyping</p>
    <p>ZenTripper is a one-stop shop for travel planning. It supports users through the entire process— from discovering a destination, to booking flights and finding activities, through to printing out a completed itinerary.</p>

    <div class= "problem">
      <p>Problem Statement</p>
      <p class= "highlight">Currently, there is no single resource that travelers can turn to when planning a trip.</p>
      <p>There are many resources for locating flights, hotels, and activities, and there are a few tools that help travelers manage their itineraries. However, there’s not a tool that can walk them through the entire process. Users want to avoid hassle and clutter while planning, and keep their resources to a minimum. <span>They want their planning experience to be as fun as the trip itself!</span></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>Interviews with 6 people, ages 26-54, M/F</p>

    <div class="left-align">
      <h3>Key Discoveries</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Travelers tend to book flights and hotels ahead of time, and then to get a sense of daily activities.</li>
        <li>New travelers go through a trial and error period where they search many travel resources, but then stick with 1-2 resources when they find one that meets their needs for a task.</li>
        <li>They may check trip feasibility periodically (without explicit travel goals), but have few tools to support this.</li>
        <li>Most are using a combination of apps to find flights and hotels, manage their itinerary, and remind them of trip-planning tasks.</li>
        <li>Users are lacking a pleasing interface to achieve all of these goals.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class= "problem">
      <p>“There’s no one place I can look for travel info, I <span>switch back and forth between many sites.</span>”</p>
      <p>“It’s <span>not exactly the smoothest process</span>, especially when websites open multiple tabs.”</p>
      <p>“I usually keep a lot of things in my head because writing it down <span>takes too much extra time</span>.”</p>
      <p>“I <span>don’t like having to figure</span> out the best flights, activities and hotels from scratch.”</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of different steps and sometimes <span>I’m afraid I forgot something</span>.”</p>
      <p>“It takes me a while to make decisions because <span>the amount of information is overwhelming</span>.”</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Product Brainstorm</h3>
    <p>Competitive Analysis</p>
    <img src="assets/img/comp-analysis.png" alt="competitive analysis" height=400>
    <p>Looking at competitors, the most unique features of ZenTripper would be ability to <span>explore destinations</span>, support for <span>finding activities</span>, ability to <span>map out the itinerary</span>, and general <span>consolidation</span> of needs.</p>
    <p class="standalone"><strong>Kayak</strong> unveiled a feature for finding activities while I was midway through this project— a great sign that I was on track and doing good user research!</p>

    <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
    <img src="assets/img/product-brainstorm.png" alt="product-brainstorm" height=350>
    <p>Features like booking flights and finding hotels <span>were expected</span>...</p>
    <p>Mapping out an itinerary or exploring destinations by budget <span>were not</span>.</p>
    <p><span>Creating balance</span> between the two was key to containing the scope of the project while enticing the target users.</p>

    <h3>User Flow</h3>

    <h3>Sketches (Paper Prototype & Testing)</h3>
    <img src="assets/img/sketches.png" alt="sketches" height=300>
    <p>How might we...</p>
    <p>make educated guesses to <span>reduce user input</span>?</p>
    <p>present information in <span>manageable chunks</span>?</p>
    <p>reduce cognitive load and <span>streamline decisions</span>?</p>
    <p>create a sense of <span>fun</span>?</p>

    <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
    <p>Users most enjoyed the exploring the new tools of the app and the automation of the informational flow from one part to the next. Onboarding may be necessary to help manage the expectations of new users on how certain features work. While interface is purposely clean, it needs to remain informative. Better labeling would help.</p>
